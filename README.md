# Usage
manip.py will look into LOGO_DIR for unaltered logos. The file names should be in the form ``[LOGO_NAME].png``.

Manipulated logos will be generated and put into the same LOGO_DIR. The generated file names will be in the form ``[LOGO_NAME].[MANIPULATION_TYPE][MANIPULATION_STRENGTH].png``.

prompt.py expects both unaltered logo files and altered logo files to be in this format.
